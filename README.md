# 23CM-TRX 

This project contains information I collected while building [PE1JPD's 23 cm NBFM Transceiver](http://www.pe1jpd.nl/index.php/23cm_nbfm/): 

* [My notes, tips and tricks](modifications) on building the kit
* [Software stuff](src) for the kit
* [Documentation and links](documentation) regarding the kit

This project is still in early development. Check back here to see progress, or help me 
by contributing pull requests to this repository.

Cheers,
Rolf
